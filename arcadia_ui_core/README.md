## Terminology
- Account: Authentication identity and credentials managed by the auth layer; one Account may be used by multiple agents.
- Profile: In‑app workspace/dataset that belongs to an Account; apps may enable multiple profiles per account.
- Agent: An actor operating the app (human or automated). Use “agent” instead of “user” in app‑level docs/UI.
